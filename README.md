Project Objective

"Design and implement a basic Arduino program to control the blinking of an LED. The project aims to familiarize with Arduino programming, circuit building, and basic electronic components. The LED will blink at a consistent rate, demonstrating understanding of digital output, timing functions, and basic coding principles."

Key Activities

1. Define Project Scope and Objectives
   - Outline the goals and expected outcomes of the project.
   - Determine the specific requirements, such as the blink rate and duration.

2. Gather Components and Tools
   - Obtain an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
   - Acquire an LED, a resistor (typically 220 ohms), jumper wires, and a breadboard.
   - Ensure you have a computer with the Arduino IDE installed and a USB cable for connection.

3. Set Up the Hardware
   - Connect the LED to the breadboard.
   - Attach the positive leg (anode) of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13) via a resistor.
   - Connect the negative leg (cathode) of the LED to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.

4. Write the Arduino Code
   - Open the Arduino IDE and write a basic program to control the LED.
   - Use the pinMode, digitalWrite, and delay functions to manage the LED's blinking pattern.

5. Upload and Test the Code
   - Connect the Arduino to the computer via USB.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
   - Observe the LED to ensure it blinks according to the specified pattern.

6. Troubleshoot and Debug
   - Verify all connections and components if the LED does not blink as expected.
   - Check the code for errors and ensure the correct port and board are selected in the Arduino IDE.

7. Document the Process
   - Record the steps taken, including the circuit diagram, code, and any issues encountered.
   - Capture photos or videos of the working setup for documentation purposes.

Technologies Used

1. Arduino Uno üéõÔ∏è
   - Information: A popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It features 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, and a reset button.
